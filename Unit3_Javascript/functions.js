// what is a function ?
'A function is a set of instructions that perform a specific task'
'for job.'

//  There are two variations of functions:
// Built-in function: these are function instructions that
// are already in the programming language and all you need to do
// is pass it data

// console.log() is an example of a built-in function
name = 'Haleem Shaw'
console.log(name)

// User defined functions: these are customs instructions that are
// written by engineers.

// How do we write a function - function syntax

function exampleFunction(){
    console.log('step 1.')
    console.log('step 2.')
    console.log('step 3.')
}

// call function
exampleFunction();
